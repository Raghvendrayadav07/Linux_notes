Control and access files 
today i studied how can i control and access any file by commands

for that i create a file by using touch filename and ls -l it will show the details of file

132324 -rwxrwxrwx 1 root root .52 feb 24 time filename 
where 
- is filetype
        filetype can be dir, regular file, symbolic link
rwx is user 
rwx is group 
rwx is other 
    now r means readable 
        w means write
        x means excutable 
        - is denied 

File types in linux system
-  regular file 
d  directory 
l  symbolic link
c charater device
b  block device 
p   named pipe
s socket

Change permissions with the symbolic method
specific syntax :- chmod[who][operator][filename]

Who - the letter specifies whose permissions are targetting 
u - user (the file owner)
g - group (user in the file assigned group)
o - others (everyone else on the system)
a - all (applies to user, group, other)

Note:- umask decide the default permissions for file 

Operators - 
+ add 
- remove
= sets

The scoring system (octal method )
4 = read 
2 = write
1 = execute 

the sum of all is 7 so you can asssign number from 0 to 7
